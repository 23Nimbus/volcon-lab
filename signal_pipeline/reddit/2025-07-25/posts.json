    "title": "AMPX DD - Batteries that will (literally) take us to the moon",
    "selftext": "Hi Degens: long time lurker, first time poster with some DD. I tried to post this a couple of weeks ago but didn\u2019t have enough karma. (Sucks for all of you cause the stock has had a great run) Read, roast me, or scroll past, but here\u2019s why I\u2019m bullish AF.\n\nTLDR: Amprius makes silicon anode batteries that destroy traditional lithium-ion cells in every performance metric. They\u2019re already shipping to defense and aerospace clients (think drones, UAVs, etc.) and drones are so hot right now.\n\nLet\u2019s get this out of the way first: Amprius makes silicon anode lithium batteries. Not fancy-sounding \u201csolid state\u201d science projects that need 7 more years in a lab. These batteries actually work, are in production, and are already in the field. Oh and also, they are best in class. \n\nEnergy Density: 2x traditional lithium. Charge Time: as low as 6 minutes. Weight: 50% lighter. Cycle Life: This is the theoretical problem with silicon anodes which has stopped them from being mass-produced. Amprius has figured out a way to get 500 cycles and it\u2019s been improving.\n\nIf you want longer range, lighter aircraft, faster charge, and a power source that doesn\u2019t need its own backpack, you want this.\n\nThese are not hypothetical specs. Drone manufacturers are already using them. Reddit reviews say that these batteries are blowing peoples minds.\n\nWHY NOW?: UAVs, Defense Spending, and a War-Obsessed World\n\nLet\u2019s talk macro: The world is falling apart and every major power is funneling cash into defense tech like it\u2019s 1942.\n\nUAVs and drones are so hot right now. They are the future of war. Read the many DDs of drone companies all over Reddit.\n\nDrones need light, energy dense, ultra-fast-charging batteries.\n\nUS Defense Dept. has already awarded Amprius contracts.\n\n\u201cWe need 500 Wh/kg batteries for tactical edge UAVs.\u201d -The Pentagon, probably\n\nAdd: Rising global tension (Middle east, China, Ukraine) Shift toward electrification of everything in combat=Near-term demand for lightweight, high-performance batteries\n\nAnd you\u2019ve got the perfect storm for Amprius to dominate military battery tech.\n\nAnd what if\u2026EVs?\n\nSilicon anode batteries are the holy grail of EVs. Double the range, Half the weight, Full charge while you refill your coffee.\n\nEV makers are all chasing new battery technology. Tesla has talked about it for years, and other OEMs are investing billions in R&D.\n\nBut guess what?\n\nAmprius already cracked it. They just need scale.\n\nTheir roadmap includes expansion into automotive-scale production by 2026\u20132027. They\u2019re currently sampling cells to automakers, and pilot programs are underway.\n\nThis is the classic \u201cpicks and shovels\u201d play. catch them before they hit the big leagues.\n\nAnd they have actual sales: This Ain\u2019t a Science Fair Project\n\nRevenue is already ramping: Q1 2024: Revenue up 225% YoY , Multiple new clients added in aerospace, drones, and defense. They literally can\u2019t make these batteries fast enough, and have partnered with manufacturers in South Korea for extra capacity.\n\n2025 and 2026 will be inflection years as new facilities go online.\n\nAlso: Insiders are NOT selling. In fact, there\u2019ve been multiple buys and strategic investments in recent months.\n\nThis is not a pump and dump dead company or some bs startup selling a ChatGpt wrapper. This is a real company, shipping a real, game-changing product, with: Massive tailwinds from global defense spending, A potential EV expansion catalyst, Crazy asymmetric upside from a $900 market cap and oh yeah\u2026 they have no meaningful competition. There are a couple other companies trying to crack silicon but Amprius already has.\n\nMost recent analyst price target is $15. And analysts, as we know, are never wrong.\n\nTHE RISKS (Because I\u2019m probably a Degenerate) Production scale risk: Can they actually build enough? Competition: Big dogs like Tesla/Panasonic could play catch-up. Battery industry is cutthroat and capex-heavy. Still not profitable (this is WSB, do we care?)\n\nBut remember, we\u2019re early. Like pre-Model S Tesla early.\n\nBuy a few shares. Forget about them. Come back when your fridge has a drone delivering your groceries, and it\u2019s powered by Amprius. \n\nPositions: Long (obviously) 3000 shares. NFA. I\u2019m just a degenerate and drone enthusiast. DYOR. Don\u2019t invest more than you can afford to lose, but be prepared to win.\n\n",

    "title": "Lithium is on the comeback with China crackdown",
    "selftext": "ALB DD: China just fucked the lithium market and nobody noticed\nTL;DR: China shut down a bunch of lithium mines and processing plants. ALB earnings are July 30.\n\n\nSo I\u2019ve been following this lithium situation and I think something major is happening that most people are missing.\n\nChina started shutting down lithium operations this month. Not just one or two companies - we\u2019re talking about a systematic crackdown:\n\n\t\u2022\tJuly 17: Zangge Mining shut down (11,000 tonnes annual capacity)\n\t\u2022\tJuly 24: 8 mines in Yichun got flagged for permit violations\n\t\u2022\tJuly 25: 12 lithium processing plants ordered to shut down for 30 days\n\t\u2022\tAugust 9: The big one - Jiaxiawao Mine\u2019s permit expires. This thing produces 120,000 tonnes annually and from what I\u2019m reading on Chinese forums, there\u2019s maybe a 20-30% chance it gets renewed.\n\nThat last one is huge. Jiaxiawao is the biggest lithium operation in the Yichun region, which they call the \u201cLithium Capital of Asia.\u201d If it doesn\u2019t get renewed, we\u2019re looking at losing about 15-20% of global lithium supply.\n\nHere\u2019s the weird part: Chinese lithium futures have been hitting daily limits for two days straight. Chinese lithium stocks are up 10-15%. But ALB is only up like 6%.\n\nI spent some time on Chinese trading forums (Google Translate is your friend) and they\u2019re going absolutely nuts about this. Thousands of posts about supply shortages and price targets. Meanwhile, if you search \u201clithium\u201d on WSB or investing subreddits, people are still talking about oversupply from earlier this year.\n\nThe timing couldn\u2019t be better for ALB earnings on July 30.\n\nQ2 results are going to suck because all this enforcement stuff started after the quarter ended. But the forward guidance call is where it gets interesting. ALB management will be the first major Western lithium company to address what\u2019s happening in China.\n\nIf they come out and say something like \u201cwe\u2019re seeing increased demand for non-Chinese lithium supply\u201d or \u201cwe expect pricing to improve in the second half,\u201d this thing could move hard.\n\nWhy ALB specifically?\n\nThey don\u2019t have any operations in China. Everything is in Chile, Australia, and the US. So while Chinese companies are getting shut down, ALB becomes more valuable as a secure supply source.\n\nThink about it from a customer perspective. If you\u2019re Tesla or CATL or whoever, and 20% of global lithium supply just became unreliable, you\u2019re going to pay a premium for guaranteed supply from stable jurisdictions.\n\nALB also has processing capabilities, which is important because 65% of global lithium processing happens in China. If Chinese processors are getting shut down too, that creates another bottleneck.\n\nSome quick math:\n\nBefore this enforcement wave, the market was expecting about 90,000 tonnes of lithium oversupply in 2025. If China really takes 150,000+ tonnes offline, we flip from oversupply to a 30,000-60,000 tonne deficit.\n\nThat\u2019s a massive change in market dynamics.\n\nRisks:\n\nObviously China could reverse course and restart everything. But this seems to be part of their broader \u201canti-involution\u201d policy to reduce overcapacity across multiple industries. It\u2019s not just lithium - they\u2019re doing similar things with steel, solar panels, etc.\n\nThe other risk is that ALB management plays it conservative on the earnings call and doesn\u2019t really acknowledge the opportunity. But even neutral guidance would probably be bullish given the setup.\n\nTechnical stuff:\n\nALB has been trying to break out of a multi-year downtrend. There\u2019s resistance around $82 but if it clears that on volume, next stop is probably $95-100.\n\nShort interest is around 22% which is pretty high. If this thing starts moving on earnings, could get interesting.\n\nWhat I\u2019m watching:\n\n\t1.\tJuly 30 earnings call - specifically any comments about Chinese supply disruptions or increased customer interest\n\t2.\tAugust 9 - whether Jiaxiawao Mine gets its permit renewed\n\t3.\tQ3 earnings season - first results that would actually show the impact of higher lithium prices\n\nI think the market is still pricing ALB based on the oversupply narrative from earlier this year. If China really is enforcing supply discipline, that thesis is dead.\n\nThe information asymmetry here is pretty crazy. Chinese markets are already pricing in a supply shock while Western markets are barely aware it\u2019s happening.\n\nCould be wrong, but this feels like one of those situations where being early pays off big time.\n\nPositions: Long 500 shares, August $85 calls, September $90 calls. Will update after earnings.",

Godspeed to me and to you, fellow regards.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0vjmd86xnwef1.png?width=1055&format=png&auto=webp&s=e338897f143c802ab699eba13562e11419a61ef0\n\n",

The post-earnings price drop was a textbook case of IV crush combined with a market overreaction. While everyone was freaking out about the intraday swing, the actual long-term story only got stronger.\n\nThis dip to $191 was great, for my covered calls I sold.\n\nHere\u2019s why I\u2019m not sweating the daily noise:\n\n1. **The $106 Billion Backlog:** This isn't a forecast. It's a backlog of committed orders, mostly for their high-margin cloud and AI services. This is future revenue that's already on the books.\n2. **The $85 Billion CapEx:** This isn't speculative spending. They are building the infrastructure required to service that massive backlog. They are investing in the machinery to print cash for the next five years.\n3. **The AI Moat:** Gemini's integration across the entire Google ecosystem (Search, Workspace, Cloud) is a long-term catalyst that the market is still struggling to price correctly.\n\nPeople who sold today traded a long-term winning strategy for short-term fear. I believe the path to a $3 Trillion valuation ($250/share) is clear, and the market just gave us a beautiful discount.\n\nwe march on to 250!",

    "selftext": "Some of you may remember\u00a0[this dd from Martin Shkreli](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/w2yt4g/lqda_long_idea/)\u00a0three years ago, well LQDA finally was able to launch their drug after dealing with some additional patent trolling from their competitor UTHR and the results for their first month of sales of June came in on wednesday, see below\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/49al2dryy1ff1.png?width=1161&format=png&auto=webp&s=2ff9ef8e2e3fd7619add6d6ea8010d42106efad9\n\nLQDA\u2019s first month sales indicate it is on track to hit almost half of annual starts, first monthly print of 224 prescriptions annualizes at 2688. At 10k/month this means 322mil annual rev. LQDA\u2019s main competitor serves about 50k prescriptions a year -if LQDA can claw some of these, the TAM is pretty significant. Pharma is pretty sticky so I won\u2019t speculate there.\n\nNote : I think some of these prescriptions go to PH-ILD patients too, see below for TAM that is a newer market.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0w0tvirzy1ff1.png?width=2233&format=png&auto=webp&s=267fa80da22338154f2079f19935300addea7196\n\n\n\nLQDA market cap at 1.6 billion and it\u2019s going to be 5x p/s at the end of this year with a real shot of increasing sales much further. Something interesting about Shkreli\u2019s first DD is he projected Tyvaso to grow to about 900 mil revenue in 2025 - Tyvaso is doing 1.8 **billion** revenue annualized right now. So this market is clearly growing a lot faster than people were projecting years ago, and there are indications that it could keep growing. I don\u2019t want to speculate too much because I know jack shit about these diseases, I just think the chart looks like it\u2019s about to blast through to new highs as wall st digests that this was a killer drug launch and, more importantly, traders are going to look at VRNA which had a similarly good launch and think that perhaps some sort of acquisition is possible.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/y2qdkia1z1ff1.png?width=2326&format=png&auto=webp&s=b40f65709db01d656e38e3fbeb0c6b66bc5b154c\n\nA lot of people are going to anchor to VRNA\u2019s acquisition by Merck, I think that is the wrong way to look at this COPD has 8.6 million patients and a lot are untreated from what I understand. I think the VRNA comparisons are wrong for many reasons, but that won\u2019t keep traders from making them, which is what I think is going to rapidly reprice this over the next few months before the market gets ahead of itself. The only reason I am including VRNA chart below is to show evidence that historically wall street waits until drug launch sales data starts to trickle in before catalyzing a rerate\n\n[VRNA drug launched in august 2024 and sold well](https://preview.redd.it/3ygyv9w3z1ff1.png?width=2378&format=png&auto=webp&s=339f1b75b680097c1db834bd4db08c80da3d7fcf)\n\nP.S. Shkreli\u2019s original DD had LQDA getting to 100mil rev in it\u2019s first year of drug launch, saturating around 27% of market share 5 years after launch. He also had projected that Tyvaso (LQDA competitor) would only be doing 900 mil of revenue in 2025, Tyvaso is on pace to do 1.8 billion. LQDA is on pace to do 300 million in revenue this yr, and if they get 27% of market that\u2019s 480 million. Shkreli\u2019s original price target was $20, I have no idea how high LQDA can go but this seems like a pretty good price to buy if you trust his DD.\n\nPOSITIONS just shares for now with a tiny position of calls since it's ran up so hard this week, I plan to buy calls if it dips\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/e34gcvd5z1ff1.png?width=1170&format=png&auto=webp&s=3ec5960188356094d0c64c4d6ac532be2e362543\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nie8d4i6z1ff1.png?width=1170&format=png&auto=webp&s=6884f9b855ffd24694dc120f3ed8881d8e68ac48",

    "selftext": "I know what WSB is thinking, another \"infinite money glitch\" post. But hear me out because this is so absurd, so unbelievably simple, tied to the most hideous footwear on the planet that it just **MIGHT** work. And if it does, we're all retiring to a private island with **UNLIMITED** pairs of Crocs.\n\nI'm talking about **Crocs call options.**\n\nNow, before you dismiss me as a madman who's spent too much time sniffing Croslite. Crocs against all odds has been crushing it. People love them, hate them, but they **buy** them. They're comfortable, versatile (especially when you put them in 4-wheel drive), and apparently, recession-proof.\n\nHere's the \"glitch\" and how we get rich with Unlimited pairs of Crocs:\n\n**Step 1: Buy Crocs Call Options.** Start small. The idea is to buy calls with an expiration slightly after their upcoming earnings on August 7^(th). Crox has been buying back a ton of their own shares at the P/E multiple of 6 (highway robbery at these prices). Earnings are going to crush come August and Crox will rerate. Once they crush and our calls go brrrrr, we go into step 2.\n\n**Step 2: Cash Out & Buy a couple pairs of Crocs Shoes.** This is the crucial part of the \"glitch.\" Take a portion of your profits from the options and buy a couple pairs of Crocs before the next earnings cycle.\n\n**Step 3: Repeat the Cycle.** Now we have \\*free\\* physical Crocs which boosted Crocs Revenues and Profits and also have more calls. **Every pair of Crocs you buy with your options gains contributes to the ongoing demand for Crocs pushing the stock price higher for the next round of call options.**\n\nIt's a prophecy of rubbery goodness! We continue the cycle until we have a lifetime supply of Crocs and a lifetime supply of gains.\n\nTLDR; Buy CROX calls with an expiration date after earnings, use your gains to buy more calls and Croc shoes for the next earnings. Repeat until retired on the beach wearing Crocs. (also I'm poor so only have 10 calls to start)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hqdarh0rwuef1.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=805d987878971b28a420ed9286af7f02f297ad63\n\n",

(the final settled price, not including After-hours trading) Guess must be in by 10:30am EST (NYT). (One hour after the opening bell)\n\n\\-An exact guess AKA the Bullseye Crew you get 2 cones for the season total standings. The count for the Bullseye Crew is just the exact number of Bullseyes this season per player.\n\n* In the result of a tie, both win a cone as both were correct.\n\n\\-No Edits: your guess is your guess, and once it is in, it cannot be changed. Early bird gets the guess. (if you edit your guess, you are disqualified for that day, sorry). If you notice your guess has already been taken, do not edit your guess but comment underneath it. At that point you can make a new guess but it still has to be in by 10:30 EST (One hour after the opening bell)\n\n\\-B2B Sniping Rule: Last guess of the day cannot win on back to back days. All guesses must be in USD amounts.\n\n\\-The seasonal standings are below the closing score and yesterday's winner. The winners circle is the hall of fame of past season winners.

    "selftext": "This analysis only assumes GME is shorted at publicly reported levels. What we know is true will lead rocket fuel to the fire. Link to charts\n\nGameStop (GME) Margin Risk Modeling and Predictive Analysis\n\r\n\u201cPower to the Players. We may have been early, but we weren\u2019t wrong!\u201d\r\n\u2013 GME Apes\n\r\nThis report presents a high-resolution analysis of the relationship between GameStop (GME) stock volatility and systemic Initial Margin (IM) multiplier changes across futures, interest rate swaps (IRS), and credit default swaps (CDS). With retail-driven volatility returning and short interest remaining elevated, a major GME price event could trigger margin expansion and liquidity crunches for overleveraged market participants.\n\n\r\nSection 1- Futures IM Multiplier vs. GME Price\n\r\nThe chart below illustrates the escalation of initial margin requirements for futures contracts under mild, moderate, and severe short squeeze scenarios triggered by specific GME price thresholds.\n(Image 1)\r\n \r\n\n\nSection 2- Staggered Margin Escalation Modeling\n\r\nThe chart below models the initial margin (IM) multiplier escalation for futures, interest rate swaps (IRS), and credit default swaps (CDS) using staggered logistic sensitivity curves. These better reflect how each instrument class reacts differently to volatility in GME price:\r\n\u2022 Futures: Fast-reacting to early volatility.\r\n\u2022 IRS: Moderate-reacting with a smoother transition.\r\n\u2022 CDS: Delayed but more severe under credit stress.\n\nThis modeling improves clarity by showing instrument-specific risk sensitivity rather than overlapping step functions.\r\n (Image 2)\n\r\n\nSection 3-Strategic Implications of Margin Escalation in GME Volatility Events\n\r\nInstitutional exposure to equity volatility is not isolated to direct equity holdings\u2014it ripples through the financial system via margin-linked instruments like futures, swaps, and CDS. The initial margin (IM) multipliers modeled here are not arbitrary\u2014they\u2019re regulatory thermometers that react to the heat of price instability and dealer leverage.\r\n\r\nIn the context of GameStop (GME), a highly shorted equity with renewed momentum and activist interest, the implications are profound. As GME\u2019s price rises sharply\u2014particularly in clustered momentum rallies typical of short squeeze conditions\u2014clearinghouses recalibrate risk models to demand higher margin from dealers. This is not just protective behavior\u2014it is mechanical de-leveraging that triggers forced position reductions across the ecosystem. Firms caught flat-footed during a margin expansion are required to post collateral or close out exposures in hours, not days.\n\r\nWhat begins as a retail-led rally in a single equity cascades through to the synthetic world of leverage and derivatives. A 40\u201360% spike in GME price could translate to margin multipliers as high as 1.40x on futures, 1.25x on IRS, and 1.25x on CDS\u2014magnifying systemic stress. This is not a theory; it is modeled policy by the CFTC, OCC, and ICE Clear. Our smoothed modeling shows precisely how those thresholds emerge across pricing strata, with futures reacting first, swaps mid-range, and CDS late but severely.\r\n\r\nFor activist investors, this means the battlefront isn't just in the share price\u2014it\u2019s in the pipes of the financial system. Strategic upward pressure on GME\u2019s price in specific zones (e.g., $35\u2013$60) can mechanically trigger de-risking among shorts due to independent clearinghouse logic, not sentiment or fundamentals. This is what \u2018The Big Squeeze\u2019 looks like when translated into margin mechanics.\n\r\n\n\nSection 4- Volatility-Price Stress Heatmap Interpretation\n\r\nTo better understand when systemic margin triggers may occur, the following heatmap models Initial Margin (IM) multiplier escalation across a range of GameStop (GME) price levels and implied volatility (IV) percentages. The left axis now uses percentage-based IV levels, ranging from 30% (calm markets) to 250% (extreme dislocation), offering clearer interpretation for retail and institutional readers alike.\r\n\r\nImplied Volatility (IV) is a forward-looking measure derived from the options market, representing how much the market expects the price of a security to move. When IV reaches high levels\u2014such as 150% or 200%\u2014it often reflects frenzied options buying (e.g., short-dated calls), dealer gamma exposure, and institutional hedging activity. \n\nGME\u2019s previous short squeezes have demonstrated IV surges well beyond 100%, coinciding with liquidity events and forced liquidations.\r\nIn this model, we define a synthetic 'stress index' as the product of normalized price and volatility:\n\r\n    Stress = (GME Price / 40) \u00d7 (IV / 50%)\r\nThis stress score approximates how central clearing counterparties (CCPs), such as the OCC or ICE Clear, respond to rising risk levels. Once stress exceeds thresholds of ~1.2 and 2.0, IM multipliers are assumed to jump from 1.05 \u2192 1.25 and then 1.4 respectively. These are consistent with CFTC-published multiplier band ranges for market dislocation events.\n(Image 3)\r\n\r\n \r\nSection 5- Historical Benchmarking of GME Margin Conditions\n\r\nTo contextualize the 2025 margin environment, we examined prior GME price dislocations and corresponding clearinghouse responses. Each event brought unique challenges to the financial infrastructure, ranging from intraday volatility spikes to full trading halts. This benchmarking exercise highlights how implied volatility (IV) and price velocity often correlate with clearing escalations, including Initial Margin (IM) multiplier hikes, collateral surcharges, and central clearing risk memos.\n\r\nBelow is a summary of key events from 2021 through mid-2025, noting the magnitude of price spikes, peak implied volatility, and the institutional response\n\r\n(Image 4)\r\n\r\nThe January 2021 event remains the gold standard for systemic exposure, where margin calls triggered liquidity shutdowns. What followed was a progressive evolution of margin management. By April 2024, the NSCC began deploying more surgical clearing mechanisms, including ETF-weighted clearing sweeps. \n\nWhile June 2025\u2019s conditions remain early-stage, IV of ~390% and ~85% price surge mirror March 2021. These suggest we may be entering the margin pressure zone once again. If historical patterns hold, next steps could include increased VaR-based surcharges or cross-product IM escalations.\n\r\nSection 6- Market Maker Impact Model\n\r\nMarket makers (MMs) play a pivotal role in absorbing the flows of directional retail order flow, especially in the equity options market. During periods of elevated implied volatility and price acceleration, MMs must delta-hedge aggressively, often exacerbating price swings in the underlying stock. \n\nThe table below models gamma sensitivity \u2014 a second-order exposure that reflects how quickly delta changes relative to the stock price \u2014 across varying GME prices and implied volatility levels.\n\n(Image 5)\r\n\nGamma increases non-linearly as share price falls and IV rises. This exposes dealers to reflexive hedging loops, particularly in the $20\u2013$40 range where GME has historically seen dense call activity. Below is the gamma sensitivity matrix (proxy model: Gamma \u221d IV / Price\u00b2)\n\r\nAs gamma sensitivity intensifies, particularly in high-IV/low-price regimes, MMs may be forced into a hedging death spiral \u2014 selling into dips and buying into rips. This reactive behavior fuels volatility rather than suppresses it, especially in names like GME with concentrated open interest at round-number strikes.\n\n\n\r\nSection 7-ETF Collateral Flow Modeling\n\n\r\nExchange-traded funds (ETFs) with exposure to GameStop (GME) vary dramatically in their market structure and impact on the underlying float. This section models three representative ETFs \u2014 XRT, IGME, and  \u2014 that have gained notoriety for their disproportionate association with GME volatility and retail sentiment.\r\nCritically, the exposure mechanics differ:\r\n- XRT is a traditional ETF that holds physical shares of GME within a diversified retail index. Creations/redemptions directly impact GME\u2019s float.\r\n- IGME and other GME ETF's do not hold direct GME shares. Instead, they utilize synthetic exposure via derivatives (total return swaps, futures, options). While they do not purchase GME shares outright, their demand can still influence price through dealer hedging obligations.\r\n\r\nBelow is the adjusted modeling table:\r\n\n(Image 6)\n\r\nConclusion: Only XRT exerts direct float pressure on GME via ETF flow mechanics. However, IGME can contribute meaningfully to market-maker hedging reflexes, especially when volatility spikes. Their derivatives-driven architecture creates a feedback loop where investor inflows \u2192 swap demand \u2192 dealer hedging \u2192 upward GME price momentum.\r\nSection VIII: Reflexive Impact on GME IV and Price\n\n\nSection8- Reflexive Impact on GME IV and Price\n\r\nThe exposure models presented in this report suggest a tightly coupled reflexive loop between dealer hedging, ETF synthetic demand, and implied volatility levels in GME. As information about margin spikes, ETF derivative exposure, and options pressure becomes publicly understood \u2014 particularly by activist retail investors \u2014 market participants may begin to front-run or defensively hedge against these dynamics. This creates a new meta-layer of volatility:\r\n\r\n1. Retail Awareness of Margin Rules: Public discussions of increased CFTC cleared margin requirements and their link to delta/gamma spikes can cause anticipatory call buying or hedging from institutions.\n\r\n2. Reflexive Feedback Loops: The act of modeling volatility triggers (like in this paper) can itself become a volatility driver. Dealers may adjust hedge ratios more quickly, increasing gamma compression.\n\r\n3. Options Market Predictive Signaling: If GME\u2019s IV increases sharply while price remains stable, it may indicate dealer stress, hidden flow imbalance, or anticipatory positioning ahead of squeeze mechanics.\n\r\n4. Narrative-Driven Price Elasticity: The more retail and institutional actors believe margin rules or ETF flows will cause dislocation, the more they may amplify them. Price response to flows becomes nonlinear \u2014 a self-fulfilling prophecy.\n\r\nAs reflexive behavior intensifies, gamma bands collapse and GME becomes highly sensitive to even modest volume surges.\n\n\r\nSection IX- JESXSC Synthetic Forward Contract Analysis\n\r\nThe JESXSC classification under ISO 20022 identifies equity-linked forward contracts with non-standard payout structures. These synthetic contracts use spread-based triggers and cash settlement logic to gain performance exposure without direct share ownership.\r\n\r\nKey findings from recent metadata (July 2025) include:\r\n- Two contracts referencing bath and GME with identical structure and synchronized timestamps.\r\n- Use of ReturnOrPayoutTrigger: Spread-bet \u2013 a trigger mechanism tied to relative price movements (e.g., AMZN crossing $220).\r\n- DeliveryType: CASH \u2013 confirming these instruments settle in fiat, not stock.\r\n\r\nThese findings indicate that synthetic forward structures were likely used to offload risk from failed shorts (e.g., bath) and re-express exposure through new tickers (e.g., GME). The link between their metadata timestamps suggests coordinated creation or lifecycle management as part of a larger synthetic unwind strategy.\r\n\r\nThis analysis reinforces the hypothesis that performance-based triggers, especially around quarterly swap reset dates, could catalyze forced cash settlements and downstream market impacts on GME volatility, options flow, and IV expansion.\r\n\r\n \r\nX. Forward-Looking Trigger Forecast (August 2025)\r\nOver the next 30 days, a convergence of structural fragility and price sensitivity will likely catalyze a volatility event in GameStop (GME), particularly if price exceeds key trigger zones ($36, $41, $49). Based on current margin models, synthetic derivative exposure, and CFTC escalation bands:\r\n\r\n- Probability of margin multiplier escalation >1.15 in futures/CDS: 72%\r\n- Probability of IV surging above 300%: 68%\r\n- Probability of ETF derivative hedging pressure: 80%\r\n- Probability of options gamma compression initiating reflexive feedback loop: 60\u201375%\r\n- Estimated GME price range by late August (under stress loop): $48\u2013$65\r\n- Estimated IV (avg across expirations): 340%+\r\n\r\nWe believe JESXSC payout triggers may activate if external benchmarks (e.g., AMZN > $220 or bath derivatives auto-expire) force a conversion. When this occurs, collateral obligations in fiat will drive underlying delta adjustments \u2014 with GME as the absorption vehicle.\r\n\r\nIn activist terms: The ammunition has been loaded. The fuse is IV. The spark will be a trigger breach.\n\r\n\ud83d\udccc TL;DR \u2013 Why Today\u2019s Setup May Be the Trigger\r\nThe stage is set. GameStop\u2019s relatively low market price, combined with depressed Implied Borrow Rates (IB), has masked a dangerous equilibrium: the synthetic short structures have yet to unwind.\r\n\r\n\ud83d\udd3b 1. Low Price = Pressure Valve:\r\nAt suppressed prices, synthetic forwards (e.g., JESXSC contracts) and hidden short exposures don\u2019t yet demand resolution. But once a trigger \u2014 like AMZN crossing $220 \u2014 activates payout logic, collateral must move.\r\n\r\n\ud83d\udcc8 2. Forward Contracts Are Now Live:\r\nConfirmed CFI metadata from July 1st shows active JESXSC derivatives tied to both bath   and GME with synchronized timestamps, cash settlement rules, and spread-bet payout logic. These were built to delay the pain \u2014 not prevent it.\r\n\r\n\ud83e\udde8 3. Imminent Conversion Mechanics:\r\nWith the underlying vehicles (e.g., DK Butterfly Trust) now legally structured to offload obligations, any price rise, IV spike, or external benchmark crossing will begin settlement \u2014 and GME is the absorption ticker.\r\n\r\n\ud83e\udde0 4. IV, ETF pressure, and margin models are converging:\r\nCombined with elevated margin modeling from the CFTC and IM increases on futures & CDS, a recursive loop may form \u2014 one that converts latent derivatives into active buying pressure.\r\n\r\n\ud83d\udca5 Conclusion:\r\nAll that's missing is ignition. The structures are armed. The documents are filed. GME\u2019s low float and high DRS make it uniquely vulnerable to reflexive price movement.\n\n\r\nReferences\n\r\nCFTC Cleared Margin Reports \u2013 June 2025.

    "selftext": "That's it, we all have our own version of rks gamestop theory depicted for ourselves. For now, I've set price alerts and im going to say the famous words \"Set it and Forget it\" \n\nIf you're in, you're in. \nIf you're out, then so be it. \n\nIm sure you've heard the saying \"Price is an illusion\" \nIt truely is an illusion.\n\nI log on my exchanges every few days to buy a couple more shares. I have a % of my shares DRS'd and plan to keep doing so. But I buy at whatever price it's at. Because at the end of the day, Ryan Cohen doesn't do what he does to be number 10 in the industry he is working in. He does what he does to be number 1 in the Industry he's in. Roaring Kitty didn't spend numerous years working on this theory to just turn his back on it. We also have to remember roaring kitty isn't a time traveler. He can't predict the future to a T. He can make theories on when things will happen, but in order for those things to happen, other crucial machines that run this earth need to be aligned correctly, for these things to happen.  That's why we've always said \"no dates\" because, RK is not a fortune teller, not a time traveler, but understands and understood what needs to be done and how it can be done. \n\nI have been buying shares since a couple months before the first sneeze, sold 0 shares on the first sneeze and have been keeping my nose pointed in the same direction ever since, adding more shares. I will add that I have gotten wrecked on all my calls, not gonna lie. (No more options for me) \n\nThere are some bearish theories out there and I choose to ignore them. That's my choice. Because I know, that after this long, after all the work and research done, partnerships that have never ended, ideas that haven't fully hit the pavement yet and I just truely beleive it's because of the state of the world today. Political chaos, war, inflation, and just down right uncertainty for what the future holds for ANYONE. \nBut I know whats waiting at the horizon for me \n(and all of us who continue to hold) \n\nI just know, in my future, I still HODL $GME\nI'm never fucking leaving. \nMy conviction is stronger than ever. \nHope my words make some others feel the same way. \nThis may be taking longer than we all hoped, but at the end of the tunnel, there is a tad bit of freedom waiting for us (for sure) and the rest of the world. (Hopefully) \n\n\n**KEY NOTES TO NOT FORGET**\n-Gamestop never ended partnerships with $imx and $lrc , one is a blockchain gaming developing platform and one is to massively scale transactions on layer 2. \n- Shorts have not covered and continue to short \n- Retail continues to buy the stock despite the shorts continuing to short. \n- Ryan Cohen said \"Let them short\" in recent financial news\n- RKs pinned tweet is a reference to waiting. I don't care how people see it, the dog waits for the owner to come back. This is about being loyal to what we know and what we want to change. \n- Rc is sitting on billions of dollars and hundreds of millions in  $btc \n- RC doesn't share his real strategy. Because it's dumb to show your hand at a poker game. Same thing with this.\n\nHead up, solider. \ud83c\udf7b\ud83e\ude96\ud83c\udf96\n\nDon't back down from making the \ud83c\udff0\ud83e\ude78dry\nHF Liquidations will ensue. \nGood day to you. ",

(the final settled price, not including After-hours trading) Guess must be in by 10:30am EST (NYT). (One hour after the opening bell)\n\n\\-An exact guess AKA the Bullseye Crew you get 2 cones for the season total standings. The count for the Bullseye Crew is just the exact number of Bullseyes this season per player.\n\n* In the result of a tie, both win a cone as both were correct.\n\n\\-No Edits: your guess is your guess, and once it is in, it cannot be changed. Early bird gets the guess. (if you edit your guess, you are disqualified for that day, sorry). If you notice your guess has already been taken, do not edit your guess but comment underneath it. At that point you can make a new guess but it still has to be in by 10:30 EST (One hour after the opening bell)\n\n\\-B2B Sniping Rule: Last guess of the day cannot win on back to back days. All guesses must be in USD amounts.\n\n\\-The seasonal standings are below the closing score and yesterday's winner. The winners circle is the hall of fame of past season winners. This is for the player with the most total wins per season. There are 250 games per season we play every day the market is trading.\n\n============================================\n\n\\*WINNERS CIRCLE\n\nSeason 1 Winner: Lorien6 ( 31 Wins )\n\nSeason 2 Winner: Bloodshot\\_Blinkers ( 34 Wins )\n\nSeason 3 Winner: isthatfair1234 ( 22 wins )\n\n**CLOSING PRICE**:\u00a0$23.96\n\n**Winning Guesses:**\u00a0$23.78 roswelljack\n\n**Notes:**\u00a0dance around the room..... dance around the room..... first cone for you.... dance around the room..... \n\n====\u00a0Season 4 Cone Winners\u00a0====\n\nisthatfair1234 (17)\n\ncyberpunkjay3243 (12)\n\nTallfeel (9)\n\nHeynow 846 (7)\n\nMusesoutloud (7)\n\navspuk (6)\n\nG\\_Wash1776 (5)\n\nExpensive-Two-8128 (4)\n\nstockmarketscam-617 (4)\n\nStevefstorms (4)\n\nGlobetrotting22 (4)\n\nNeilsberry427 (3)\n\ntendie\\_mcnuggets (3)\n\nWalrusSoliloquy (2)\n\nPrestigious\\_Ebb3167 (1)\n\neciptic10 (1)\n\ncosmotropik (1)\n\nLongjumping\\_Wash9556 (1)\n\nPhat\\_Kitty\\_ (1)\n\nDustey-CSK1 (1)\n\nLeftnutbrown (1)\n\nDynastyFSU2 (1)\n\nsyoung907 (1)\n\nMikeman1971 (1)\n\nBiggJermm (1)\n\nTLDCrafty (1)\n\n6\\_Pat (1)\n\nroswelljack (1)\n\n===\u00a0Bullseye Crew S4\u00a0===\n\ncyberpunkjay3243 (2)\n\nisthatfair1234 (1)\n\nGlobetrotting22 (1)\n\nHeyNow846 (1)\n\ntallfeel (1)\n\navspuk (1)\n\nExpensive-Two-8128\u00a0(1)",

    "selftext": "First off, shoutout to Mike Hands\u2014the man with the \"hands\" that's got the community buzzing. With GME's \u201creported\u201d short interest still hovering at 25-30% of the float, per recent data, this timing? Chef's kiss.\n\nThe lineup starts strong with battle-themed games like Army of Two, Battlefield: Bad Company, and Assassin's Creed Valhalla. Picture this: misfit soldiers (us apes) forming an \"army of two\" to take down corrupt corporations in chaotic wars. Valhalla's Viking raids? That's retail storming Wall Street, assassinating short positions stealthily for that sweet Valhalla payoff. Tie in Watch Dogs: Legion (emphasized twice for a reason)\u2014a legion of hackers recruiting citizens to hack surveillance overlords and spark uprisings. Sound familiar? It's the ape legion exposing naked shorts and DRS-ing shares to overthrow hedgie control. Set in a dystopian 2030s, but feels like now with all the market manipulation drama. \n\nThen we hunt and trap: Big Game Hunter tracking apex predators (big shorts like Citadel), Goat Simulator's chaotic GOAT (Greatest Of All Time\u2014Cohen or Roaring Kitty?) flipping the script so shorts get wrecked, and Marvel's Spider-Man webbing up villains in a squeeze they can't escape. Add Titanfall 2: a lowly rifleman bonds with a massive Titan mech to dismantle an interstellar corp exploiting the frontier. Underdog apes calling in \"titans\" like earnings catalysts to crush overleveraged bears\u2014time's up for their \"fall.\" Gameplay's fast, vertical chaos? That's GME volatility spiking. \n\nCrime and exposure ramp up with GTA's heists satirizing greed (retail \"stealing\" gains via squeeze), True Crime's undercover cop unraveling mafia corruption (exposing illegal shorting), and Mortal Kombat 1's rebooted universe where underdogs deliver fatal blows in tournaments. Liu Kang resetting timelines for a new era? That's Cohen architecting GME's turnaround, ending with brutal Fatalities on shorts. The Definitive Edition's chaos and deception? Mirrors the dark pool games we're seeing today. Speaking of which... \n\nCheck this block trade tape lighting up: Massive dark pool buys at $24.10 (ask) and $23.88 (bid), institutional whales accumulating pre-breakout. \"Someone was accumulating below the breakout zone then hit the gas... it\u2019s a transfer of power. Smart money\u2019s loading. Shorts are realizing it.\nAnd volatility? \"Put IV just overtook Call IV... positive vanna + dealer buying = grinding bid unlikely to be stopped. Targets: $25, then $27+.\n\nApe vibes seal the deal: Donkey Kong's barrel-throwing primate (apes strong together!), Super Mario Party's mini-game rivalries collecting stars (post-squeeze gains), and Super Mario 3D World's co-op rescues with power-ups (3D chess strategy leading to world domination). Now toss in Super Mario Party Jamboree: a festive trek planning the ultimate party, gathering items across boards to thwart Bowser (shorts). The Switch 2 bundle with Jamboree TV? Media exposure for the big celebration. It's all building to a jamboree blowout after the quests (hold through volatility) are done. \n\nTechnicals are screaming bullish too. \"With CCI overbought, RSI neutral, bollingers pinching, and convertible note arbitrage\u2014we have a 'Shaft Squeeze' pattern. Extremely Bullish $GME. Could blow any day no. P rice flipping green last minute: \"This shit gonna run. I can feel it in my monkey nuts. \n\nThe narrative arc is crystal: Armies battle bad actors (setup the war), hunt/trap with chaos (execute the plan), heist/expose crimes (climax the exposure), deliver mortal finishes (decisive win), and party like jamboree champs (victory lap). WWE belt in the center? Apes as undisputed kings post-MOASS. With GME's $4B cash hoard, low debt, and catalysts like Switch 2 and Pok\u00e9mon drops, this video's a wink from inside. Mike Hands is the hero signaling unity\u2014diamond hands trigger the squeeze.\n",

    "selftext": "Haven\u2019t seen this before but I\u2019ve been thinking about it so figured I\u2019d share for discussion. Don\u2019t have enough xp for the big sub but whatever. \n\nAt the end of the squeeze in April 2021, RK exercised options to buy 50k additional GME shares bringing him up to around 200k total. Fast forward to June 2024 he owned 9 million shares. Thats a 45x increase in basically 3 years (38-ish months). \n\nNow, the way that financial gains work, it takes money to buy whiskey: the more money you have, the more money you can make, faster, with the same strategies. If you had a cycle and strategy you know worked and you increased your position 45x through options etc in basically 3 years, you could potentially do that again in another three years, assuming your strategy held and your balls we\u2019re big enough. \n\nThe public float is 408 million shares. If RK would 45x his last known 9M position that would bring him to\u2026405 million. If it took him the same time period to do so, that would be August of 2027. And while RC did dilute initially to raise capital, lately he\u2019s been issuing convertible bonds. Those first bonds don\u2019t have the possibility of converting and increasing the total shares outstanding until 2030\u2026well after the time period it would theoretically take for RK to literally lock the float if my previous statement is true. \n\nNot saying I\u2019m hoping it takes that long or am trying to provide fake hype dates but just a thought I had. Tell me why I\u2019m regarded. \n\nEdit: I\u2019ve been reminded of the stock split in 2022. That would put RK at roughly 800k shares meaning he roughly 10x his position by June 2024. By that rate of growth, it would take 4.5ish years to lock the float or around December 2028. ",

Yes. Well, let\u2019s keep it that way by not falling for what has effectively been a persistent trap over the years.\n\nAny companies that have ever \u201cwon\u201d anything in the civil courts has ALWAYS resulted in absolute peanuts for shareholders, everything gets sealed and NDA\u2019d to death, oh, and the fucking perps get to walk away.\n\nNo fucking thank you- I want my \u201cfuck you, pay me\u201d no cell, no sell money, while the $GME naked shorts pull a forced Bernie Madoff.\n\nIt should be obvious to all by now that GameStop must win in the arena of the markets themselves if shareholders (including retail investor Ryan Cohen himself) are to realize the maximum true value for their shares of $GME.\n\nIf Quantum BioPharma CEO wants to win, he and his company must do the same.\n\n#RC said it best: \u201cLet \u2018em short\u201d",

(the final settled price, not including After-hours trading) Guess must be in by 10:30am EST (NYT). (One hour after the opening bell)\n\n\\-An exact guess AKA the Bullseye Crew you get 2 cones for the season total standings. The count for the Bullseye Crew is just the exact number of Bullseyes this season per player.\n\n* In the result of a tie, both win a cone as both were correct.\n\n\\-No Edits: your guess is your guess, and once it is in, it cannot be changed. Early bird gets the guess. (if you edit your guess, you are disqualified for that day, sorry). If you notice your guess has already been taken, do not edit your guess but comment underneath it. At that point you can make a new guess but it still has to be in by 10:30 EST (One hour after the opening bell)\n\n\\-B2B Sniping Rule: Last guess of the day cannot win on back to back days. All guesses must be in USD amounts.\n\n\\-The seasonal standings are below the closing score and yesterday's winner. The winners circle is the hall of fame of past season winners. This is for the player with the most total wins per season.
